1. Write a method called toMilesPerHour that has 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometersPerHour.
This method needs to return the rounded value of the calculation of type long.

If the parameter kilometersPerHour is less than 0, the method toMilesPerHour needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

Otherwise, if it is positive, calculate the value of miles per hour, round it and return it.
For conversion and rounding, check the notes in the text below.

Examples of input/output:
* toMilesPerHour(1.5); → should return value 1
* toMilesPerHour(10.25); → should return value 6
* toMilesPerHour(-5.6); → should return value -1
* toMilesPerHour(25.42); → should return value 16
* toMilesPerHour(75.114); → should return value 47


2. Write another method called printConversion with 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometersPerHour.

This method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX km/h = YY mi/h".

XX represents the original value kilometersPerHour.
YY represents the rounded milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

If the parameter kilometersPerHour is &lt; 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".


Examples of input/output:
* printConversion(1.5); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 1.5 km/h = 1 mi/h
* printConversion(10.25); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 10.25 km/h = 6 mi/h
* printConversion(-5.6); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): Invalid Value
* printConversion(25.42); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 25.42 km/h = 16 mi/h
* printConversion(75.114); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 75.114 km/h = 47 mi/h


Use method Math.round to round the number of calculated miles per hour(double). The method round returns long.


How to use the method round and how it works?

The Math.round() is a built-in math method which returns the closest long to the argument.
The result is rounded to an integer by adding 1/2, taking the floor of the result after adding 1/2,
and typecasting the result to type long.
The method returns the value of the argument rounded to the nearest int value.

USAGE EXAMPLE:

double number = 1.5;
long rounded = Math.round(number);
System.out.println("rounded= " + rounded);
System.out.println("with 3.9= " + Math.round(3.9));
System.out.println("with 4.5= " + Math.round(4.5));
int sum = 45;
int count = 10;

double average = (double) sum / count;
long roundedAverage = Math.round(average);
System.out.println("average= " + average);
System.out.println("roundedAverage= " + roundedAverage);


OUTPUT:

rounded= 2
with 3.9= 4
with 4.5= 5
average= 4.5
roundedAverage= 5



TIP: In the method printConversion, call the method toMilesPerHour instead of duplicating the code.

NOTE: All methods should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: 1 mile per hour is 1.609 kilometers per hour



3. Write a method called printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes that has 1 parameter of type int with the name kiloBytes.

   The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the megabytes and remaining kilobytes
   from the kilobytes parameter.

   Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX KB = YY MB and ZZ KB".

   XX represents the original value kiloBytes.
   YY represents the calculated megabytes.
   ZZ represents the calculated remaining kilobytes.

   For example, when the parameter kiloBytes is 2500 it needs to print "2500 KB = 2 MB and 452 KB"

   If the parameter kiloBytes is less than 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".


   EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT

   * printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(2500); → should print the following text: "2500 KB = 2 MB and 452 KB"

   * printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(-1024); → should print the following text: "Invalid Value" because parameter is less than 0.

   * printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(5000); → should print the following text: "5000 KB = 4 MB and 904 KB"


   TIP: Be extremely careful about spaces in the printed message.

   TIP: Use the remainder operator

   TIP: 1 MB = 1024 KB

   NOTE: Do not set kilobytes parameter value inside your method.

   NOTE: The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces.
   NOTE: The printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

4. Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.

   The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

   If the parameter is not in that range return false.

   Otherwise, if it is in the valid range,
   calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is a leap year,
   otherwise return false.


   To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
   1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise go to step 5.
   2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
   3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
   4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return true.
   5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return false.

   The following years are not leap years:
   1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
   This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

   The following years are leap years:
   1600, 2000, 2400
   This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.

   Examples of input/output:

   * isLeapYear(-1600); → should return false since the parameter is not in range (1-9999)

   * isLeapYear(1600); → should return true since 1600 is a leap year

   * isLeapYear(2017); → should return false since 2017 is not a leap year

   * isLeapYear(2000);  → should return true because 2000 is a leap year

   NOTE: The method isLeapYear needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

5. Write a method hasEqualSum with 3 parameters of type int.

   The method should return boolean and
   it needs to return true if the sum of the first and second parameter is equal to the third parameter.
   Otherwise, return false.


   EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

   * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 1);  should return false since 1 + 1 is not equal to 1

   * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 2);  should return true since 1 + 1 is equal to 2

   * hasEqualSum(1, -1, 0);  should return true since 1 + (-1) is 1 - 1 and is equal to 0


   NOTE: The hasEqualSum method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
