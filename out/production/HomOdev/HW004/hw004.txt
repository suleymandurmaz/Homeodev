2. Write another method called printConversion with 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometersPerHour.

This method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX km/h = YY mi/h".

XX represents the original value kilometersPerHour.
YY represents the rounded milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

If the parameter kilometersPerHour is &lt; 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".


Examples of input/output:
* printConversion(1.5); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 1.5 km/h = 1 mi/h
* printConversion(10.25); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 10.25 km/h = 6 mi/h
* printConversion(-5.6); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): Invalid Value
* printConversion(25.42); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 25.42 km/h = 16 mi/h
* printConversion(75.114); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 75.114 km/h = 47 mi/h


Use method Math.round to round the number of calculated miles per hour(double). The method round returns long.


How to use the method round and how it works?

The Math.round() is a built-in math method which returns the closest long to the argument.
The result is rounded to an integer by adding 1/2, taking the floor of the result after adding 1/2,
and typecasting the result to type long.
The method returns the value of the argument rounded to the nearest int value.
